        question: "What makes Shaper different from other edtech?",
        answer: "Shaper GAAPI doesn’t teach content — it evolves you. While other platforms focus on what you know, Shaper measures how you think, decide, lead, and grow. It adapts to your behavior, builds personalized challenges, and gives real-time feedback that actually sticks. It’s not a course, it’s a growth system."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I use this with my team?",
        answer: "Yes — Shaper is built for both individuals and teams. Managers can view collective skill maps, track real progress, and design training paths based on actual behavior, not self-assessments. It's like having a soft skills coach for your whole team — data-driven, personal, and proven."
    },
    {
        question: "How does the AI give feedback?",
        answer: "Shaper’s AI observes how you respond in games, dilemmas, and simulations — then gives feedback based on patterns in your decision-making, timing, and communication. It doesn’t just say “right or wrong.” It shows how you behave under pressure — and what to do next to improve."
    },
    {
        question: "Do I need to be “a gamer”?",
        answer: "Not at all. Our games are short, simple, and designed for real life — not for gamers. If you’ve ever answered a tough question, made a quick decision, or led a conversation, you already have the skills. We just help you unlock them."
